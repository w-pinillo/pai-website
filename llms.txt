## 1. Company Overview

Pai specializes in making advanced data analytics and AI accessible to non-technical users. It solves the problem of businesses collecting large volumes of transactional data but lacking the tools to extract strategic insights. The core solution, the **Delta platform**, acts as an intelligent analytics engine that automates data analysis and reveals actionable opportunities for growth and profitability.

## 2. Core Concepts

*   **Customer Lifecycle:** Within Pai, this refers to the stages a customer goes through, from acquisition to loyalty and potential churn. The Delta platform specifically tracks metrics to identify customers in each stage (e.g., new customers, repeat buyers, at-risk customers).
*   **Business Health Indicators:** These are key metrics beyond just sales (e.g., customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, purchase frequency) that the Delta platform monitors to provide a holistic view of business performance.
*   **Actionable Insights:** This is Pai's core value proposition. It means presenting data not as raw numbers or complex charts, but as clear, specific recommendations. For example, instead of just showing a sales dip, Delta might suggest a targeted campaign for a customer segment whose purchasing frequency has dropped.
